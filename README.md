# Guide to setup self-managed dashboards in EC2 hosted container

## Prerequisite
A managed service OpenSearch domain with SAML authentication enabled. [Reference here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/saml.html
)

## Steps to spin up a self-managed dashboards
1. Create an EC2 instance within the identical VPC where the managed service OpenSearch domain is operating to run the self-managed dashboards and capture its endpoint.
2. Create a new Application in your `IDP` with the self-managed dashboards endpoint which would generate a new IDP metadata
3. Copy the new IDP metadata of the newly created application and paste it into the IDP metadata text box found in the `Configure identity provider (IdP)` section within the security configuration tab of the managed service domain in aws console
4. Replace the self-managed dashboards url in the security configuration file with the self-managed dashboardsâ€™ endpoint. The purpose of this is to guarantee that after the user is authenticated in IDP, the redirection occurs to the self-managed dashboards instead of the managed service dashboards.

> [!NOTE]
> Customers do not have access to modify the security configuration file due to security reasons hence raise a support ticket to request a change to the self-managed URL endpoint
[Refer here](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/security/authentication-backends/saml/#minimal-configuration-example). By running the below API call, customer can validate the `kibana_url` changes in security configuration file. `_opendistro/_security/api/securityconfig`*

5. Install docker and its dependencies on the EC2 instance
6. Use the attched `docker-compose.yml` file and run the self-managed opensearch dashboards
7. After the container is up and running, access it by using the command `docker exec -it <CONTAINER ID> bash` and then modify the `opensearch_dashboards.yml` file by adding the SAML specific attributes. Once the modifications are made, restart the container using `docker restart <CONTAINER ID>`. Find the sample `opensearch_dashboards.yml` file. [Refer here](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/security/authentication-backends/saml/#opensearch-dashboards-configuration)
8. Post container restart you can access the self-managed OpenSearch Dashboards by hitting the EC2 endpoint with port 5601. By doing so, you can conveniently view and interact with all the saved objects in accordance with the Fine-Grained Access Control settings and SAML authentication.
*Note: When using docker in EC2 instance, the self-managed OpenSearch Dashboards cannot be accessed over the internet. It is only accessible by machines within the same VPC.*
